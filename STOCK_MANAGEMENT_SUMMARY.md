# Stock Management System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Complete stock management system for dealers, farmers, and admin with automatic stock tracking when orders are placed or cancelled.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Product Addition (Dealer)
**Route:** `POST /products/dealer/add`

**Features:**
- ✅ Dealer can add products with multiple images (1 main + up to 5 gallery images)
- ✅ Two stock tracking fields:
  - `quantity`: Visible stock that farmers see (required)
  - `warehouseQuantity`: Internal dealer tracking (optional, defaults to quantity)
- ✅ Images are uploaded to ImageKit and stored as URLs
- ✅ Products can be saved as draft or published
- ✅ Only verified shops can add products

**Example Flow:**
```
Dealer adds product:
- Product Name: "Premium Wheat Seeds"
- Quantity: 20 (visible to farmers)
- Warehouse Quantity: 20 (dealer's internal tracking)
- Images: 1 main + 3 gallery images
```

### 2. Stock Reduction on Order Placement
**Route:** `POST /orders/place`

**How It Works:**
1. Farmer adds products to cart and places order
2. System validates:
   - Product exists and is published
   - Product is available (`isAvailable = true`)
   - Sufficient stock available (`quantity >= ordered quantity`)
3. **Stock is immediately reduced:**
   - `quantity` decreases by ordered amount
   - `warehouseQuantity` decreases by ordered amount
   - If `quantity` reaches 0, `isAvailable` is set to `false`

**Example:**
```
Initial State:
- Product has quantity: 20
- Product has warehouseQuantity: 20

Farmer orders 1 item:
- quantity: 19 ✅
- warehouseQuantity: 19 ✅

Another farmer orders 5 items:
- quantity: 14 ✅
- warehouseQuantity: 14 ✅
```

### 3. Stock Restoration on Order Cancellation
**Routes:**
- `PATCH /orders/farmer/:orderId/cancel` (Farmer cancels)
- `PATCH /orders/dealer/:orderId/status` (Dealer cancels)

**How It Works:**
1. Order can be cancelled if status is `placed` or `assigned`
2. **Stock is restored:**
   - `quantity` increases by cancelled amount
   - `warehouseQuantity` increases by cancelled amount
   - Product becomes available if `quantity > 0`

**Example:**
```
Before Cancellation:
- quantity: 14
- warehouseQuantity: 14

Order with 5 items cancelled:
- quantity: 19 ✅ (restored)
- warehouseQuantity: 19 ✅ (restored)
```

### 4. Admin View
**Route:** `GET /admin/products`

**Features:**
- ✅ Admin can see ALL products (published and draft)
- ✅ Admin can see `warehouseQuantity` (not visible to farmers)
- ✅ Admin sees complete product details:
  - All images (main + gallery)
  - Stock quantities (quantity + warehouseQuantity)
  - Product status (published/draft, available/unavailable)
  - Shop and dealer information

### 5. Farmer View
**Route:** `GET /products/farmer/list`

**Features:**
- ✅ Farmers only see published and available products
- ✅ `warehouseQuantity` is HIDDEN from farmers (using `.select('-warehouseQuantity')`)
- ✅ Only products with `quantity > 0` are shown
- ✅ Smooth purchasing experience without seeing internal stock

## Stock Management Logic Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    PRODUCT LIFECYCLE                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. DEALER ADDS PRODUCT
   ├─ quantity: 20 (visible stock)
   ├─ warehouseQuantity: 20 (internal tracking)
   └─ isAvailable: true

2. FARMER PLACES ORDER (1 item)
   ├─ quantity: 19 ✅ (reduced)
   ├─ warehouseQuantity: 19 ✅ (reduced)
   └─ isAvailable: true

3. ANOTHER FARMER ORDERS (5 items)
   ├─ quantity: 14 ✅ (reduced)
   ├─ warehouseQuantity: 14 ✅ (reduced)
   └─ isAvailable: true

4. FARMER CANCELLS ORDER (5 items)
   ├─ quantity: 19 ✅ (restored)
   ├─ warehouseQuantity: 19 ✅ (restored)
   └─ isAvailable: true

5. STOCK EXHAUSTED (quantity = 0)
   ├─ quantity: 0
   ├─ warehouseQuantity: 0
   └─ isAvailable: false (product hidden from farmers)
```

## Key Files Modified

### Backend Routes:
1. **`backend/routes/productRoutes.js`**
   - Product addition with multiple images
   - Proper warehouseQuantity handling
   - Admin/dealer/farmer views

2. **`backend/routes/orderRoutes.js`**
   - Stock reduction on order placement
   - Stock restoration on order cancellation
   - Validation and error handling

3. **`backend/routes/adminRoutes.js`**
   - Admin product view (includes warehouseQuantity)

### Database Model:
- **`backend/models/Product.js`**
   - `quantity`: Visible stock (required)
   - `warehouseQuantity`: Internal tracking (optional, default: 0)

## Security & Validation

1. ✅ **Stock Validation:** Checks sufficient stock before reducing
2. ✅ **Shop Verification:** Only verified shops can add products
3. ✅ **Role-Based Access:** 
   - Dealers: See warehouseQuantity
   - Admins: See warehouseQuantity
   - Farmers: Don't see warehouseQuantity
4. ✅ **Transaction Safety:** Stock validated before order placement

## Console Logging

All stock changes are logged for debugging:
```
✅ Stock reduced for product "Product Name": quantity=14 (was 19), warehouseQuantity=14 (was 19)
✅ Stock restored for product "Product Name": quantity=19, warehouseQuantity=19
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Dealer adds product with quantity and warehouseQuantity
- [ ] Multiple images upload successfully
- [ ] Farmer places order - stock reduces correctly
- [ ] Multiple farmers order - stock reduces correctly
- [ ] Order cancellation restores stock
- [ ] Admin sees warehouseQuantity
- [ ] Farmer doesn't see warehouseQuantity
- [ ] Product becomes unavailable when stock = 0
- [ ] Product becomes available when stock restored > 0

## Notes

- **Warehouse Quantity** is dealer's internal tracking and defaults to same as `quantity` if not provided
- Stock is reduced **immediately** when order is placed (not when order is processed)
- Stock is restored **only** when order is cancelled (not when delivered)
- Admin has full visibility of all stock details for monitoring
